## Smart Contracts
There are three smart contracs:
1. **kyber.sol:**
It allows you to swap tokens through KyberSwap. (:exclamation:Update: KyberSwap is no longer available).
2. **uniswap.sol:**
It allows you to swap tokens through Uniswap V1.
3. **flashloan.sol:**
Implementation of DyDx flash loan. You just need to specify the exchanges and tokens involved in your transactions when calling the function **initiateFlashLoan**. In order for the transaction to be successful, you will need to search for opportunities, whether your preferred strategy is arbitrage, yield farming or other.
**Only three exchanges are supported**: Uniswap, Sushiswap and DAI+USDC+USDT+TUSD CurveFinance's pool.
